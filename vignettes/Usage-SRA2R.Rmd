# Introduction
Initially named as Short Read Archive (SRA), the Sequencing Read 
Archive is an initiative from from the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the European Bioinformatics 
Institute (EBI), and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), and it was 
developed to allocate raw sequencing data from biological studies, 
processed by different platforms as Roche-454 Life Sciences, Illumina 
Solexa and Applied Biosystems SOLiD.
